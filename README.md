Neural Network for Collision Prediction

Purpose
Collect training data for a robotics task and, in turn, design a neural network that can process this data. In the assignment your goal is to help a small robot navigate a simulated environment without any collisions. To accomplish this, I need to train a neural network using backpropagation that predicts whether the robot is going to collide with any walls or objects in the next time step. 

Objectives
● Collect and manage a dataset used to train and test a neural network.
● Define and use PyTorch DataLoaders to manage a PyTorch Datasets.
● Design your own neural network architecture in PyTorch.
● Evaluate and improve a neural network model and verify an application in simulation.

Technology Requirements
● System designed for use with Ubuntu 18.04
● Python and its related libraries. Using Anaconda is recommended.
● Python libraries: cython matplotlib sklearn scipy pymunk pygame pillow numpy noise
